FLASHCARD APP -- GOOGLE DEVELOPER GROUP RECRUITMENTS

A flashcard app designed to make learning easier for complex topics like Data Structures, Algorithms, Cybersecurity, Database Systems and many more computer science topics.

This app has been implemented using Flutter sdk.
OpenAI API used to generate questions for the flashcards
(However my quota for the API has run out and thus there are no questions showing up in the flashcard,
I have been going through paths of signing another API key/ syncing questions databases)

- Starts off with a login/sign up page which then leads to the homepage.
- Homepage contains a progress tracker circle (not implemented yet as flashcards aren't working)
- Followed my the progress tracker circle is the subject boxes which in turn lead to subject wise topics pages.
- When user clicks on a particular topic, they enter directly into the flashcard page (Feature in mind : a pop up for the user to input number of flashcards to be tested and then click confirm to move into flashcards)
- Homescreen also contains and Explore page to add more subjects
- Courses page that lists 'MY Courses' as well as 'Interested Courses'
- Menu on the right with Profile, Settings and Help page
- Feature to toggle between light and dark mode
